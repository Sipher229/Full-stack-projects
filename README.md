# Historica
This website allows the user to find out what happened on a particular date in history. The website fetches the data from 
a API called [Swager](https://byabbe.se/on-this-day/#/).

To run this website, run
`npm install`
to install all the node packages,
and then run
`npm start`
The website will run on http://localhost:3000

I would be happy to receive insights and advice on how to improve the application.
